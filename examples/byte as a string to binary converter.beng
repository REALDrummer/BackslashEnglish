##< The program takes in all the command line arguments, reads each one as an unsigned byte (0 - 255, inclusive), and prints out a string representing that byte in binary 1s and 0s. >#
for each Argument in Arguments:
	byte? Number := read Argument as a byte
	if Number is an error,
		print Parsed Argument
	else,
		string Bits := "00000000"

		from i := 0 to 8:
			Bits[i] := Number & 1 as a string
			Number >>= 1
			if Number = 0,
				i := 8

		print Bits
