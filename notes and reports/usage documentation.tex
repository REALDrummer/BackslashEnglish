\subsection{Compilation}

\subsection{The Basic Basics}
\subsubsection{Comments}
\indent I mention comments first because they'll be used in future examples within this documentation.
\indent The octothorpe ('\#') begins single-line comments:
\begin{code}
some code		\comment{\# a comment}
\comment{\#\#\#\#\#\#\# comment comment comment}
more code		\comment{\#\# more comment with more \#s!}
\end{code}
\indent Octothorpes can be paired with angle brackets ('<' and '>') to make multi-line or inline comments:
\begin{code}
some \comment{\#< awesome >\#} code

\comment{\#\#\#< You can have as many \#s as you want and they don't
even have to match the number at the end! >\#\\}
code
\comment{\#< You can also have nested comments to make commenting out sections of code easier. 
I commented out the code below even though it also has multi-line comments.\\

\#< This is a comment >\# Here is some code that is commented and bad\\

Still, the comment doesn't end at the first ">" followed by an "\#"; it matches them like parentheses. 
>\#}
more code
\comment{\#\#< below is a pretty cool operator that we'll explain and even show you how to make later; this two-\# could be used as a doc comment (maybe?) >\#}
\define{\type{type of chars}}{string}
\qquad\type{chars}\defpunct{;}
\end{code}

\subsubsection{\texttt{main(}... Oh, Wait}
\indent There is no main method/function/operator. Just write what you want to do!

\subsubsection{Variables and Math}
\indent \name{} is strongly, statically typed. Variables need to be declared and need to be declared with a type. Variable declarations follow the same classic C-like format of a type followed by a name. Note that \name{} convention is the reverse of Java and many other languages: capitalize the first letter(s) of the variable names and keep types lowercase.

\begin{code}
\type{int} Integer
\type{queue} Queue
\end{code}

In \name{}, there's a bit of a twist: in this language, types, variable names, and other operators can have spaces, can be defined with special character-matching operators, and more. (See Section \ref{subsec:Operators} later on.)
\begin{code}
\type{int} Number of Variables
\type{list of queues of pairs of ints and floats} My Beautiful Queues
\end{code}

\paragraph{Standard Number Types}
\indent \name{} includes a wide variety of different types of numbers; some have static memory sizes and some don't. Here are some of the most basic number types that do \emph{not} have set memory sizes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \type{number} is any kind of number, floating point or integer, static or arbitrary size, etc.
	\item \type{decimal} is any kind of rational number, including integers, floating-point numbers, or any special kinds of numbers like integral fractions or square roots calculated lazily. All \type{decimal}s are types of \type{number}s.
	\item \type{integer} is any kind of integer or any size, arbitrary or static. All \type{integer}s are types of \type{decimal}s.
\end{itemize}

\indent \name{} also includes a few types of numbers of static size:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \type{byte} is an 8-bit integer.
	\item \type{int} is a 32-bit integer.
	\item \type{float} is a 32-bit (single-precision) floating point number (IEEE-style).
\end{itemize}

\indent Other features of number types will be described in \ref{sssec:TypeModifiers}
